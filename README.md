#Developer
I am software engineer. I like to get involved in projects that challenges myself and increase my knowledge.  I can take advantage of any opportunity that life has to me.  Thanks to 4 years of experience in this professional field, I master languages ​​such as PHP and JavaScript using frameworks like Laravel and some others.  At this moment I'm learning Ruby. The idea is to keep growing in this that literally never ends
